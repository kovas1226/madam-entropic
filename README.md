# Entropic Psychic API

A conversational API delivering symbolic life predictions backed by an internal quantum simulator.
## Vision
Entropic Psychic API aims to inspire creativity and provide symbolic insights into life's questions using cutting-edge quantum simulation and AI technologies.
## Setup

```bash
pip install -e .
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

## Usage

Send a `POST` request to `https://entropic-api.onrender.com/predictlife` with JSON:

```json
{
  "question": "<your question here>"
}
```

The API will return a JSON object with a symbolic impression, for example:

```json
{
  "symbol": {
    "label": "The Anchor",
    "category": "Stability",
    "tone": "Grounded",
    "meaning": "Hold steadyâ€”your foundation is stronger than you think."
  }
}
```

If you want technical details (for debugging or curiosity), add `"include_details": true`:

```json
{
  "question": "Show me the details",
  "include_details": true
}
```

The API will then also return a `details` object with bitstring, entropy, and qubit count.

**Note:**  
The actual human-like, specific response is generated by GPT using these impressions, not by the API itself.

This project is for entertainment and creative inspiration only.

## Example Client

```python
import httpx

user_question = input("Ask your question: ")
response = httpx.post(
    "https://entropic-api.onrender.com/predictlife",
    json={"question": user_question}
)
print(response.json())
```
